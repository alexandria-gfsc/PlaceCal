<h2 id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Partners and Places both contain a lot of shared functionality. They can also only currently be linked in very crude ways (Partners manage Places), which is resulting in some on-the-ground situations not being mappable into PlaceCal. This would roll both into one model with a variety of toggleable functionality. We need to find a way to simplify and improve the possibilities of relationships between Places, Partners and the rest of the site.</p>

<h2 id="decision-drivers">Decision Drivers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Places and Partners are not intuitive units and duplicate a lot of functionality.</li>
  <li>It’s desirable to have multiple different relationship types between real-life assets such as multiple people managing one place.</li>
  <li>There’s a lot of duplicated code that can be removed, adding to maintainability.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="considered-options">Considered Options</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Migrate to having one type, Partners, that have Place functionality as a toggle. Relationships are all partner to partner.</li>
  <li>Keep the system as it is by adding many relationship types between Partners and Places. Risks creating even more duplication of functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="decision-outcome">Decision Outcome</h2>

<p>Chosen option 1.</p>

<p>Positive Consequences:
 * Less code, making it easier to maintain
 * A single relationship table will make for clearer and more deterministic relationships
 * Allows more complex relationships between multiple partners.
 * Events can be owned by multiple partners</p>

<p>Negative consequences:
 * A lot of work to clean up messy forms and re-do relationships
 * Could be difficult to decide what is shown on each partner’s page
 * Multiple relationship types can make permissions messy</p>

<h2 id="work-to-do">Work to do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Parters currently have the most functionality, so use as base type.</li>
  <li>Migrate all Places to Partners, and delete.</li>
  <li>Add is_a_partner boolean to show that they should show up on the frontend</li>
  <li>is_a_place boolean now indicates if open to the public</li>
  <li>Create Partner relationship table with options (see below)</li>
  <li>Update Addresses, Calendars, Sites and Turfs to only link to Partners</li>
  <li>Update frontend to only have Partners</li>
  <li>Events can belong to organiser Partners and venue Partners</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="partner-relationships">Partner Relationships</h3>

<p>Calendar examples</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calendars are assigned to Partners</li>
  <li>Events can assign themselves to an extra Partner with the Location field on address match.</li>
</ul>
